# Deep Set Neural Networks 

We learn to implement ["Energy Flow Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05165) for MCs mapping using Keras and TensorFlow (v.2). This repo contains the code samples that are compatible with the CxAOD input formate.

**Project Objectives**:
+ Develop a generalized classification for the VH(bb/cc) analysis through Deep Set neural networks.
+ Test the application running in the various computing environment (HTCondor, SLURM, GCP, HPC...). The project is also built off of an interactive way of running code in Jupyter Notebook.
+ Speed up the data preprocessing and the NN training using DASK, Ray... etc.

**Train NN**:

(continuing...)

Run the application using SLURM:
`sbatch myscript.sh`

**Performance**:

(continuing...)
`sbatch plot_Script.sh`
